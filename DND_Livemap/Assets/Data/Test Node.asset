  Name: Node Template
  Body: This is a template for you to create your nodes with. Just type in all of
    the necessary lore you wish to have in this location into this text box, and
    it will automatically fill into the info page once assigned to a node correctly!
    You dont need to do any page manipulation either, it will handle all of that
    on its own! So get out there and go make some dope ass lore!
